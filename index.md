title: Closed-Form Matrix Elements for Arbitrary-Valence SU(2) Nodes via Generating Functionals
---

<div class="abstract">
<strong>Abstract:</strong> We derive closed-form expressions for SU(2) operator matrix elements on arbitrary-valence nodes by extending the universal generating functional approach with source terms. Our central result is a determinant-based formula incorporating group-element dependence, which yields all matrix elements via a single Gaussian integral and hypergeometric expansion.
